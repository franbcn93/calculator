Students will work in groups to create a simple calculator using jQuery event listeners and JavaScript if/else or switch statements.

Steps

Fork this repository.
CLone Your fork.
cd into the folder for this project.
open index.html in the browser and bring up the JavaScript console.
open the project folder in your code editor.
In js/simple-calc.js write the code neccesary to make a functioning calculator.
The calculator should do the following:

the calculator should store 2 separate numbers as variables.
the calculator should store the operation the user chooses as a variable holding a string: '+', '-', '*', '/'.
when a user clicks increment or decrement buttons it should add one or subtract one from a variable storing that number and update the h2 with a class="number" showing the updated number.
When the user clicks the operation buttons it should change the string that is being stored in the operation variable.
When the user clicks the equals button, the calculator should update a result variable based on the operation choosen and the value of the two numbers. It should then report the result into the h2 with an id="result".
